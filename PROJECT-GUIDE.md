# AdPrism Project Guide

## Overview
AdPrism is a two-part system: a **React frontend** that displays advertising campaigns, and a **Python ingestion pipeline** that fetches, AI-tags, and stores campaigns from 170+ sources.

---

## Frontend (`adprism/adprism/src/`)

### App Shell
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `main.jsx` | Entry point — mounts the React app |
| `App.jsx` | Main shell — manages 5 views (Feed, Saved, Videos, Categories, Brand), wires up all hooks and components |

### Components (`src/components/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `Sidebar.jsx` | Left nav panel — logo, view tabs, filter chips (industry/campaign type/region), stats counters. Slides in as a drawer on mobile |
| `Topbar.jsx` | Search bar + sort pills (All, Industry, Brands, Media). On desktop: buttons left, search right. On mobile: hamburger + search |
| `Feed.jsx` | Scrollable campaign list with date-grouped headers and infinite scroll via IntersectionObserver |
| `CampaignCard.jsx` | Individual campaign card — shows title, summary, tags, expandable "Strategic Breakdown" section. Handles 3 content types (brand_campaign, industry_news, tactical_format). Supports CJK text with proper fonts. Footer uses flex layout: channel name (left, wraps on overflow) + "AI summary" pill (right, fixed width via `flexShrink: 0` / `whiteSpace: nowrap`) |
| `HeartSaveButton.jsx` | Heart icon with animated burst/particle effects on save |
| `StatBar.jsx` | Top stats banner — today's new campaigns, brands tracked, video ads, trending industry |
| `NotificationPrompt.jsx` | Push notification opt-in banner — requests FCM permission and saves token |

### Hooks (`src/hooks/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `useCampaigns.js` | Fetches campaigns from Firestore with real-time updates (`onSnapshot`), applies filters, handles pagination (10 per page). Also exports `useGlobalStats` for unfiltered aggregate counts |
| `useFilters.js` | Manages all filter state — industries, campaign types, regions, dates, sort mode, search text. Provides toggle/clear/reset functions |
| `useSaved.js` | Real-time subscription to saved campaigns. Optimistic UI updates on save/unsave |

### Styles (`src/styles/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `tokens.css` | Design system — CSS custom properties for colours, typography, tag colours, glassmorphism, shadows. Has dark mode support |
| `global.css` | Resets, font imports (DM Sans, Noto Sans/Serif for CJK), glass effects, responsive breakpoints (768px), scrollbar styling |

### Firebase (`src/lib/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `firebase.js` | Initialises Firebase app, Firestore, and Cloud Messaging. Handles device fingerprinting, FCM token saving, notification permissions, and foreground message listener |

### Config
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `vite.config.js` | Vite setup — base path `/adprism/`, React plugin |
| `firebase.json` | Hosting config — serves from `dist/`, SPA rewrites |
| `firestore.rules` | Security rules — campaigns readable by all, only `saved`/`dismissed` fields writable; FCM tokens write-only |

---

## Ingestion Pipeline (`adprism/adprism-ingest/src/`)

### Entry Point
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Orchestrator — fetches sources → deduplicates → AI processes → saves to Firestore → sends FCM notifications → cleans up old campaigns. CLI flags: `--recent` (40min), `--backfill` (12hr), `--hours N`, `--source <name>` (filter by brand), `--no-dedup` |

### Source Fetchers (`src/sources/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `youtube.py` | Fetches YouTube channel RSS feeds (Atom). Handles both `UC...` channel IDs and `@handle` resolution. Returns 15 most recent videos per channel |
| `rss.py` | Generic RSS feed fetcher. Uses `trafilatura` to extract full article text from links. Falls back to feed summary if extraction fails |

### Processing (`src/processing/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `claude.py` | **AI tagging engine** — sends text (+ YouTube thumbnail for video URLs) to Gemini 2.5 Flash. Classifies each item as `brand_campaign`, `industry_news`, or `tactical_format` and returns structured JSON with breakdowns. Rotates across 4 Gemini API keys. Has anti-hallucination rules for visual-heavy content |
| `dedup.py` | SQLite-based URL deduplication — stores MD5 hashes of seen URLs in `seen.db` |
| `prioritise.py` | Sorts items by `published_at` descending (newest first) |

### Database (`src/db/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `firestore.py` | Saves campaigns to Firestore using MD5(url) as doc ID (natural dedup). Has cleanup for campaigns >3 years old (unless saved). Migration helpers for legacy data |

### Notifications (`src/notify/`)
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `fcm.py` | Sends FCM push notifications — reads device tokens from Firestore, formats notification with campaign titles, marks campaigns as `is_pushed`. Two-tier duplicate prevention (Firestore flag + FCM collapse key) |

### Config
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `config.py` | Defines all 170+ sources across 5 categories: CAT1 (global brands), CAT2 (client/industry), CAT3 (local brands), CAT4 (ad media RSS), CAT5 (production houses). Also contains `BRAND_INDUSTRY_MAP` (150+ brand→industry mappings) |
| `seed.py` | Injects 4 mock campaigns for UI testing |
| `requirements.txt` | Python deps: anthropic, firebase-admin, feedparser, trafilatura, requests, google-genai, etc. |

## GitHub Repository Secrets

All secrets are stored in **GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. They are injected at runtime in CI/CD — no local `.env` file is needed.

### How to Add or Update a Secret

1. Go to the repo on GitHub: `github.com/ccy-hs/adprism`
2. Click **Settings** (top tab)
3. Left sidebar → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. To add a new secret: click **New repository secret**, enter the name and value, click **Add secret**
5. To update an existing secret: click **Update** next to the secret name, paste the new value, click **Update secret**

### Where to Get Each Secret Value

| Secret | Where to find it |
|--------|-----------------|
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts → **Generate new private key** → copy the entire JSON file contents |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` (×4) | Google AI Studio → [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) → **Create API key** → copy the key string. Create 4 separate keys for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_2`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_3`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_4` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Your apps → **Web app** → `apiKey` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Same location → `appId` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Same location → `authDomain` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Same location → `messagingSenderId` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Same location → `projectId` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Same location → `storageBucket` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` | Firebase Console → Project Settings → Cloud Messaging → **Web Push certificates** → Key pair (copy the public key) |

### Backend (Ingestion Pipeline)
| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Firebase service account JSON — used by `firestore.py` and `fcm.py` for Firestore writes and push notifications |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Primary Gemini API key — used by `claude.py` for AI tagging |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_2` | Gemini API key #2 — rotated via key pool in `claude.py` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_3` | Gemini API key #3 — rotated via key pool in `claude.py` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_4` | Gemini API key #4 — rotated via key pool in `claude.py` |

### Frontend (React / Firebase Hosting)
| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase Web API key |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase app ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Firebase auth domain |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | FCM sender ID — used for push notifications |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Firebase project ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Firebase storage bucket |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` | VAPID key — used for web push subscription in `firebase.js` |

---

## GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `deploy.yml` | **Build and Deploy** — triggers on push to `main` (when `adprism/` changes) or manual `workflow_dispatch`. Builds Vite frontend with Firebase env vars injected, deploys to Firebase Hosting |
| `ingest-full.yml` | **Full Ingest (All Sources)** — manual `workflow_dispatch`. Runs the Python ingest pipeline across all sources. Inputs: `mode` (backfill/recent/custom), `hours` (6–1440, for custom mode) |
| `ingest-test.yml` | **Test Ingest (One-Off)** — manual `workflow_dispatch`. Runs a single-source test ingest with `--no-dedup`. Inputs: `source` (required brand name), `hours` (6–168) |

---

## Cron Job (External Workflow Trigger)

The ingestion pipeline is triggered on a schedule by an **external cron job** (e.g., cron-job.org) that calls the GitHub API to dispatch a workflow.

### How It Works

The cron job sends a POST request to:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/ccy-hs/adprism/actions/workflows/ingest-full.yml/dispatches
```

With headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer <FINE_GRAINED_PAT>
Accept: application/vnd.github+v3+json
```

And body:
```json
{"ref": "main"}
```

### How to Renew the Personal Access Token (PAT)

Fine-grained PATs expire. When the cron job starts returning **403 Forbidden**, generate a new one:

1. Go to **GitHub.com** → profile picture → **Settings**
2. Scroll down left sidebar → **Developer settings**
3. **Personal access tokens** → **Fine-grained tokens**
4. Click **Generate new token**
5. Fill in:
   - **Token name**: e.g. `adprism-actions`
   - **Expiration**: pick a duration (e.g. 90 days)
   - **Repository access**: **Only select repositories** → choose `ccy-hs/adprism`
6. Under **Permissions** → **Repository permissions**:
   - **Actions**: **Read and write**
   - **Contents**: **Read** (usually auto-selected)
7. Click **Generate token** and **copy it immediately**
8. Go to your cron job service, update the **Authorization** header value to:
   ```
   Bearer <your-new-token>
   ```

### Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 403 Forbidden | Token expired or missing permissions | Generate a new fine-grained PAT (steps above) |
| 404 Not Found | Wrong workflow filename in the URL | Check `.github/workflows/` for the correct filename (`ingest-full.yml`, `ingest-test.yml`) |
| 422 Unprocessable | Wrong `ref` value or missing body | Ensure body is `{"ref": "main"}` |
